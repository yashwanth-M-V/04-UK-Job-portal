Why we do it: future energy will not look like energy as we know it today. We need to not just think about our future, but build for it. Now. **What you'll do:**

Strong attention to detail is essential.We have challenging technical problems to solve; like processing tens of millions of meter readings a day.  

  

We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption. Or thinking about how we adapt Kraken to improve other utilities like water and broadband.  

There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular.

You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our generation arm is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and is funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future. **What team you will be working on:**

We carry not just people but also goods, materials and provide essential transport links for emergency services.

Our engineers in Highways and Traffic focus on the development and implementation of engineering solutions to ensure that our diverse road users and different modes of travel are catered for and can continue to move about, forming the foundation of the above ground transport network infrastructure in a world class city.

As a Highways and Traffic Engineering apprentice, you’ll work with one of our teams or delivery partners in designing transport infrastructure which could include cycle lanes, improvements to active travel, transformational highways schemes, bus priority schemes, improvements to junctions to make them safe and accessible for our customers or assist in the ongoing renewal of existing assets to keep them fit for purpose. The challenges and requirements on each project are different which makes this an exciting and fulfilling job day to day.

You will develop valuable skills and gain a broad range of industry experience by taking the first step on a career path in engineering and the future of London’s roads.  


**What will I be doing?**

You would be working in a team of experienced engineers and would assist in the preparation and production of plans, designs, and documentation on our projects to relevant codes of practice and industry standards, such as the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM), the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB), British and European Standards, statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as TfL’s streetscape and local guidance all in compliance with health, safety and wellbeing requirements.

You will also learn how to apply engineering principles and techniques, carry out calculations and data analysis, prepare and produce sketches, diagrams, and models, to support technical problem solving in the delivery of civil engineering designs and technical solutions. You will use a range of tools and techniques, including digital techniques (such as AutoCAD, AutoTrack, Key Signs) to aid the visualisation, communication, and appraisal of our Highways \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\& Traffic projects.

Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints (e.g., in relation to any financial interests and employment relationships). This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm, and also prohibitions on certain employment relationships (e.g., you are not permitted to hold a secondary employment role with SEC audit clients of the firm whilst being employed by the firm). The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process or you can contact the Independence team upon request.

Why You
You are working towards an upper‑class degree in a physical science such as Physics, Engineering, Mathematics, or a related discipline. You bring a solid understanding of core optical principles—including ray and wave theory—and ideally some hands‑on lab experience in optics or microscopy. You’ll thrive in an interdisciplinary environment, working at the interface of physics and biology, and you enjoy applying problem‑solving skills to real experimental challenges. Experience with simple scripting or modelling tools (MATLAB, Python, ImageJ, Labview) is valuable, alongside a collaborative mindset, strong communication skills, enthusiasm for learning, and evidence of academic achievement. Experience with breadboard optical systems or biochemical systems is a bonus but not required.
